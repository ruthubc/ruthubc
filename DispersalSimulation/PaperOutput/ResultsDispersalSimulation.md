    by minimum dispersal size. Competition type ranges from 0 to 1, with
    0 being full scramble competition and 1 is full contest competition.
    Individual size varies from 0 to 1. Environmental variance is 0.*

    survival, by minimum adult dispersal size and competition type.
    Competition type ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 being full scramble
    competition and 1 is full contest competition. There is no
    environmental variation.*

    measure of whether any populations within the metapopulation
    produced dispersers at any time. 0 means no disperal took place, 1
    dispersal did take place. No environmental variation*

What affects dispersal?

1.  *Figure \[Disp\]: Showing how competition type and minimum adult
    dispersal size interact to affect whether any dispersal took place.
    Black squares indicate no dispersal took place, light grey squares
    indicate dispersal occurred. The square with the black outline is
    the one combination of competition and minimum dispersal size where
    dispersal did take place, but the metapopulation did not survive to
    500 generations.n Environmental variation is set to zero.*

1.  *Figure \[EnvDisp\]: Showing how competition type and minimum adult
    dispersal size interact to affect whether any dispersal took place
    with environmental variation. Black squares indicate no dispersal
    took place, light grey squares indicate dispersal occurred and
    intermediate greys indicate dispersal took place in some
    metapopulation. With environmental variation dispersal has gone from
    zero to some dispersal when size is 0.6 and competition is 0, size
    is 0.8, comp is zero, and when size is 0.8 and comp is 0.2*
