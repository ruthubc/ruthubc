(@) _Figure :Metapopulation survival against competition type, where competition
type ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 being full scramble competition and 1 is full
contest competition. Environmental variance is `r env1` and number of offspring
set to `r no_off`. No generations removed_


As competition changes from scramble to contest competition the metapopulation
age increases, but this interacts with the body size needed to disperse, unless
the populations survive to 500 generations, in which cases obviously.

**Both dipsersal and intraspecific compeition type affects metapopulation survival**


#### Why dispersal increases metapopulation survival?

The simulation only starts with x number of colonies, but there are ‘spaces’ for
200. More dispersal means that these spaces get filled up. 

#### How does this interact with competition? 

If food is shared via contest competition then normally some individuals will
get enough food to disperse, even if individuals have to be large to disperse. 
However if food is shared via contest competition then this is not the case.

type ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 being full scramble competition and 1 is full

function_

As competition increases the population survival time increases. But the size
needed to disperse surprisingly does not have a massive effect on population
survival esp compared to competition.

**The main thing that affects population survival is compeition type, dispersal has little effect**

Survival calculated from survival function_

From this graph we can see that dispersal affects whether populations survival
affects metapopulation survival. When the size needed to disperse is 0.2 (i.e.
low) then the metapopulation survives to 500 generations regardless of the
survival of the populations. The higher the disperal size is, the more the
population survival affects the metapopulation survival.

Conclusion
---
Competition affects population survival and therefore metapopulation survival,
but low population survival is off-set by disperal to increase metapopulation
survival.

Intermediate environmental variance increases metapopulation survival for some
competition measures when dispersal is restricted.

Also it appears that surprisingly, increasing environmental variation does not seem to decrease population survival
