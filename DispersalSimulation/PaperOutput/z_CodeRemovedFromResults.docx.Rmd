(@) _Figure :Population survival against competition type, where competition
type ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 being full scramble competition and 1 is full
contest competition. Environmental variance is `r env1` and number of offspring
set to `r no_off`. All generations included. Survival calculated from survival
function_

As competition increases the population survival time increases. But the size
needed to disperse surprisingly does not have a massive effect on population
survival esp compared to competition.

**The main thing that affects population survival is compeition type, dispersal
has little effect**
