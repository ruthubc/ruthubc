* Could have comp between the instars otherwise in contest comp the young will never get enough when there are adults about!
	- assume only juvs and adults and that comp occurs between them - assume the juvs get fed by other means?
* Then we can have it perhaps that individuals dispserse if they do not get fed for several time periods?????
