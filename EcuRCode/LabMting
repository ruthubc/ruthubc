Notes from lab meeting Dec 3rd 2013

Nest size
- colour the nests individual colours
- categorize nests by size and compare leg size by age and histograms of weight/size
- paper Lubin from 80's sp.  something wu (science?) -- paper is dispersal by swarming in a social spider 
analysis
- weigh points by sample size


Box trials
- change order of axis of capture vs feeding
- is fine to remove zeros... "of those that ate...."
- error distribution: poisson
- sub2s just not that hungry?
- index: add 1 to zeros
- hunger vs behaviour: temp? hunger?
- make graph of behaviour vs hunger

Other notes:
- Evenness measure Pielou's J-- what about sample size? Do I have to take account of sample size?
