- categorize nests by size and compare leg size by age and histograms of weight/size
- paper Lubin from 80's sp.  something wu (science?)
analysis
- weigh points by sample size


Box trials
- change order of axis of capture vs feeding
- is fine to remove zeros... "of those that ate...."
- error distribution: poisson
- sub2s just not that hungry?
- index: add 1 to zeros
