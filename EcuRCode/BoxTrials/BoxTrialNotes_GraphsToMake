Graphs to make for Box Trials and General Notes
 
 - Behaviour vs weight difference
 - Compare time eating and capture between different trials
 - Prey capture and weight
 - Prey capture and hunger
 - Hunger ranks
 - Maybe binary ...does not move vs prey capture
 - Behaviour rank vs feeding and capture
 - Measure of diversity/uneveness simpsons index 
 		(perhaps more unsuitbale Shannon- Weiner index- to do with uncertaintiy)
 		BUT what about zeros??
 		
 - maybe test/graph everything against instar? ..perhpas it was just because 
 - Prey capture vs feeding fraction
 
 POINT ABOUT HUNGER AND DIFFERENT INSTARS
 --I think I need to rank hunger within instars.. or at least standardize it
 	-- might be different for different instars!!
 	-If I ranked then due to different number of individuals not such a great plan so
 	... transform to make the same mean and variance!
