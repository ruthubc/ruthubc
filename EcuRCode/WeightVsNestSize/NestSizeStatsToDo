Tests to do for weight vs nest size
Multivariate analysis??.. need to look up some stuff about multivariate analysis

1) Weight = number of females in nest^2 + number of females + instar + interaction with instar 
	+ random (nest + location??) + all interactions
		--- do both with and without single female nests
		
2) Repeat above for leg length

3) coevar of weight = # of fems ^ 2 + number of fems
	random: nest and sample size
	
4) single vs multipe nests: size = nest type + random: location and nest
